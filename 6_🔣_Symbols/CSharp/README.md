# C# Code Examples

This folder contains C# code examples demonstrating various programming concepts for the General Coding self-learning project.

## 🚀 Quick Start in Codespaces

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK (pre-installed in GitHub Codespaces)

### Build and Run Commands

```bash
# Navigate to the C# project directory
cd "6_🔣_Symbols/CSharp"

# Restore dependencies and build the project
dotnet build

# Run the application
dotnet run
```

### Alternative Commands

```bash
# Build and run in one command
dotnet run --project "6_🔣_Symbols/CSharp/GeneralCodingCSharp.csproj"

# Build in release mode
dotnet build --configuration Release

# Run with verbose output
dotnet run --verbosity normal
```

## 📚 What's Included

The sample application demonstrates:

- **Basic Data Types**: Integers, doubles, strings, booleans
- **Collections & LINQ**: Lists, filtering, transformations, aggregations
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism
- **Exception Handling**: Try-catch-finally blocks
- **Async/Await**: Asynchronous programming patterns

## 🏗️ Project Structure

```
CSharp/
├── Program.cs                    # Main application with examples
├── GeneralCodingCSharp.csproj   # Project configuration
└── README.md                    # This file
```

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand C# syntax and language features
- Practice object-oriented programming principles
- Learn modern C# patterns and best practices
- Explore asynchronous programming concepts

## 🔧 Development Tips

- Use `dotnet watch run` for automatic rebuilding during development
- Add `--verbosity diagnostic` for detailed build information
- Use `dotnet clean` to clean build artifacts before rebuilding

## ✅ Expected Output

When you run the application, you should see:
- Welcome message with emoji formatting
- Demonstrations of each programming concept
- Formatted output showing results of various operations
- Completion message

This example is designed to run seamlessly in GitHub Codespaces with the pre-installed .NET SDK.
