## 🚨 Error Analysis

**Primary Error**: CS0017 - Multiple entry points defined
- The project has both `OceanViewSolution.cs` and `OceanViewTests.cs` with Main methods
- C# projects can only have one Main method as the application entry point

**Secondary Issues**: Nullable reference type warnings
- CS8625: null literal conversion in Building constructor (line 16)
- CS8600, CS8604, CS8618: Various nullable reference warnings in test file

## ✅ Resolution Steps

### 1. Fix Multiple Entry Points Issue
**Problem**: Both main solution and test files have Main methods
**Solutions**:
- **Option A**: Separate projects (recommended)
- **Option B**: Remove Main from test file  
- **Option C**: Use compiler directive /main

### 2. Fix Nullable Reference Warnings
**Fix Line 16**: Change `string name = null` to `string? name = null`
**Fix Test File**: Add nullable annotations where needed

### 3. Project Structure Recommendations
```
QuestionBuildings/
├── OceanView.csproj          # Main console app
├── OceanViewSolution.cs      # Implementation with Main
└── Tests/
    ├── OceanViewTests.csproj # Test project  
    └── OceanViewTests.cs     # Tests without Main
```

### 4. Immediate Fix Commands
```bash
# Fix the nullable reference in Building constructor
# Change line 16: string name = null  →  string? name = null

# Remove the Main method from OceanViewTests.cs
# Keep only the Main method in OceanViewSolution.cs

# Rebuild
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

### 🎯 Expected Results After Fix
- `dotnet build` should succeed without errors
- `dotnet run` should execute the ocean view examples
- All nullable reference warnings resolved
- Clean separation between implementation and tests

## ✅ Resolution Applied

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Multiple Entry Points**: Moved tests to separate `Tests/` directory with own .csproj
2. **Nullable References**: Added `string?` and `= null!` annotations  
3. **Target Framework**: Changed from net8.0 to net9.0 (available runtime)
4. **Project Structure**: Excluded Tests folder from main project compilation

### Final Working Commands:
```bash
cd "6_🔣_Symbols/QuestionBuildings" 
dotnet build && dotnet run
```

### Successful Output:
```
Build succeeded.
    0 Warning(s)
    0 Error(s)

=== Test Case 1: Example ===
🏢 Building Heights Configuration:
Heights: [5, 3, 2, 4, 1]
🌊 Ocean View Analysis:
Building 0 (height=5): ✅ CAN SEE OCEAN
Building 3 (height=4): ✅ CAN SEE OCEAN  
Building 4 (height=1): ✅ CAN SEE OCEAN
🎯 Result: Buildings with ocean view: [0, 3, 4]

Performance Comparison:
Basic Algorithm: 3834209 ticks
Optimized Algorithm: 1250 ticks
Results match: True
```

### New Project Structure:
```
QuestionBuildings/
├── OceanView.csproj          # Main console app (net9.0)
├── OceanViewSolution.cs      # Implementation with Main method
├── requirement.md            # Problem specification
├── README.md                # Documentation
└── Tests/
    ├── OceanViewTests.csproj # Test project with project reference
    └── OceanViewTests.cs     # Unit tests (no Main method)
```

## 📝 Lessons Learned
- Separate test projects prevent Main method conflicts
- Use available .NET runtime versions (9.0 vs 8.0)  
- Nullable reference types require explicit annotations
- Project structure matters for clean builds
- Performance difference: O(n²) vs O(n) = 3000x faster!
