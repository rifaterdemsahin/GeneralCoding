# 1.3.1 Objective: PHP Development Setup and Examples

## 🎯 Primary Objective
Develop and execute PHP code demonstrating web development concepts and modern PHP features.

## 📊 Key Results
- [-] Create PHP project structure in `6_🔣_Symbols/PHP/`
- [-] Implement sample code demonstrating:
  - Basic data types and variables
  - Arrays and associative arrays
  - Object-oriented programming (classes, interfaces, traits)
  - Error handling and exceptions
  - File I/O operations
  - JSON handling and web APIs
  - Database connections (PDO)
- [-] Configure PHP environment and extensions
- [-] Document setup and execution instructions
- [-] Successfully run PHP code on macOS environment
- [-] Resolve PHP interpreter and extension setup

## 🛠️ Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Tasks
- None yet - pending implementation

### 🚧 Current Blockers
- **Project Structure**: Need to create PHP directory and files
- **PHP Installation**: Verify PHP interpreter availability on macOS
- **Extensions**: May need to install additional PHP extensions
- **Web Server**: Consider local development server setup (built-in or Apache/Nginx)

## 🔗 Related Files
- **Implementation**: `6_🔣_Symbols/PHP/` (to be created)
- **Configuration**: composer.json for dependencies (to be created)
- **Documentation**: README.md with setup instructions (to be created)
- **Issues**: `7_🌀_Semblance/` (for any runtime or configuration errors)

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. Create PHP project directory structure
2. Verify PHP installation or install via Homebrew
3. Write comprehensive PHP examples covering modern features
4. Set up Composer for dependency management
5. Test PHP execution (CLI and web context)
6. Document any macOS-specific PHP setup requirements

## 💡 Learning Outcomes Expected
- Master PHP syntax and modern language features (PHP 8.x)
- Understand object-oriented programming in PHP
- Practice web development patterns and APIs
- Experience PHP ecosystem tools (Composer, frameworks)
- Learn local development environment configuration
