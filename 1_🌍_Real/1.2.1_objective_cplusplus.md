# 1.2.1 Objective: C++ Development Setup and Examples

## 🎯 Primary Objective
Implement and run C++ code demonstrating core programming concepts and modern C++ features.

## 📊 Key Results
- [-] Create C++ project structure in `6_🔣_Symbols/CPlusPlus/`
- [-] Implement sample code demonstrating:
  - Basic data types and variables
  - STL containers and algorithms
  - Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)
  - Memory management (smart pointers, RAII)
  - Template programming and generic functions
  - Exception handling
- [-] Configure build system (CMake or Makefile)
- [-] Document compilation and execution instructions
- [-] Successfully compile and run code on macOS environment
- [-] Resolve C++ compiler and toolchain setup

## 🛠️ Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Tasks
- None yet - pending implementation

### 🚧 Current Blockers
- **Project Structure**: Need to create C++ directory and files
- **Toolchain Setup**: Verify g++ or clang++ compiler availability on macOS
- **Build System**: Choose between CMake, Makefile, or simple compilation
- **Dependencies**: May need to install development tools via Xcode Command Line Tools

## 🔗 Related Files
- **Implementation**: `6_🔣_Symbols/CPlusPlus/` (to be created)
- **Build Configuration**: CMakeLists.txt or Makefile (to be created)
- **Documentation**: README.md with compilation instructions (to be created)
- **Issues**: `7_🌀_Semblance/` (for any compilation or runtime errors)

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. Create C++ project directory structure
2. Verify C++ compiler installation (clang++ on macOS)
3. Write comprehensive C++ examples covering modern features
4. Set up build configuration (CMake recommended)
5. Test compilation and execution
6. Document any macOS-specific setup requirements

## 💡 Learning Outcomes Expected
- Master C++ syntax and modern language features (C++17/20)
- Understand memory management and RAII principles
- Practice STL usage and template programming
- Experience cross-platform C++ development
- Learn build system configuration and dependency management
