# 1.1.1 Objective: C# Development Setup and Examples

## 🎯 Primary Objective
Run C# code successfully and demonstrate various programming concepts through practical examples.

## 📊 Key Results
- [+] Create C# project structure in `6_🔣_Symbols/CSharp/`
- [+] Implement sample code demonstrating:
  - Basic data types and variables
  - Collections and LINQ operations
  - Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance)
  - Exception handling patterns
  - Async/await programming
- [+] Configure project with .csproj file for .NET 8.0
- [+] Document build and run instructions
- [-] Successfully execute code on macOS environment
- [-] Resolve .NET SDK installation issues

## 🛠️ Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Tasks
- **Project Structure**: Created `6_🔣_Symbols/CSharp/` directory
- **Main Program**: Implemented `Program.cs` with comprehensive examples
- **Project Configuration**: Added `GeneralCodingCSharp.csproj` targeting .NET 8.0
- **Documentation**: Created detailed README.md with usage instructions

### 🚧 Current Blockers
- **Environment Setup**: .NET SDK not installed on macOS
- **Installation Issues**: Homebrew requires sudo password for system-wide installation
- **Resolution in Progress**: Multiple installation strategies documented in Semblance folder
