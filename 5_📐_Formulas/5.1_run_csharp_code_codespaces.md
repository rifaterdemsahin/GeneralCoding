GitHub Copilot: To run the C# program in Program.cs, you should use the .NET CLI. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Navigate to the project directory:  
   CSharp

2. Run the program using the following command:
```bash
dotnet run
```

This will build and execute the `Program.cs` file as part of the `GeneralCodingCSharp.csproj` project. Would you like me to run this command for you?
